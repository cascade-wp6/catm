*catm* - cellular automata
========================================================

This repository is a collection of functions and code usable to run cellular automata simulations in R. The aim is to develop it into a valid and distributable R-package. 
 
For now, it contains example models that were published in peer-review articles:

  - Conway's game of life: [version1](/gameoflife.r)
  - A vegetation facilitation model (KÃ©fi et al. 2008): [version1](/facilitationmodel.r),  [version2](/transitions_Kefi.r)
