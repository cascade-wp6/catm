# *catm* - cellular automata

This repository is a collection of functions and code usable to run cellular automata simulations in R. The aim is to develop it into a valid and distributable R-package. 
 
For now, it contains standalone files with examples that were published in peer-review articles:

  - Conway's game of life: [version1](/gameoflife.r). This is the most famous cellular automaton. Read more about it on [Wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). 
  - A vegetation facilitation model (KÃ©fi et al. 2008): [version1](/facilitationmodel.r).  This is Sonias application of cellular automata to simulate spatial vegetation structure from simple assumptions on facilitation. The cellular automata used in cascade are building upon this model. 



## R

You will need R to run the code. Download the latest version for your operating system from [here](http://stat.ethz.ch/CRAN/) and install it. It is a command line based program. You just copy phrases or lines of code into the R terminal and they immediately return a value. For more convenient use of R, I recommend using an integrated development environment (IDE) such as RStudio. 

## RStudio: an IDE for R

You could manipulate the R code  with any text editor and copy the lines of code to the R terminal. Chose whatever you prefer to open and manipulate the files. However, for R there is a very convenient programming environment called [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop). It provides you with all you need to use R, like the documentation of functions, a file browser and a preview of the available R objects. 

## Animated output with *ImageMagick*

If you like to create animated gifs as a visualisation of the simulation you will need to install another little program called ImageMagick. You can download it [here](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php).  Install it whereever you like, but you need to make sure
